# Climate Change and Covid-19
## Overview:
This project focuses on the impacts of the early spread of Covid-19 on posts related to #ClimateChage on Twitter.
### Final Report Abstract
This project focused on looking at the relationship between the spread of the Covid-19 in early 2020, and public attention to climate change on twitter. We analyzed data from almost 3,00,000 tweets spread over 71 days and compared our findings with data from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. Through this analysis we discovered moderate negative correlation between the daily number of tweets and interactions with climate change related tweets, and the number of confirmed Covid 19 cases. We also determined there was no significant change in the average daily sentiment of climate change related tweets in correlation with the number of Covid-19 Cases. These findings lead us to conclude that the spread of Covid-19 may have resulted in decreased public attention to climate change.
